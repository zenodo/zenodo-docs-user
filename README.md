# Getting Started

static content management system.

## Install and running Lektor

Lektor can be installed either as an macOS desktop application *or* as a
command line tool.

### Desktop Application

Download and install the desktop application from
[Lektor's website](https://www.getlektor.com/downloads/).

Next, launch the application and browse to ``zenodo-docs-user.lektorproject``
in the root folder of the repository and open the file.

### Command Line Tool

Copy/paste the following to your command prompt to install Lektor (or see
[Lektor's website](https://www.getlektor.com/downloads/) for alternative ways):

```console
$ curl -sf https://www.getlektor.com/install.sh | sh
```

Next, go into the root directory of the repository and run
the following command and open
[http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) in your browser afterwards:
