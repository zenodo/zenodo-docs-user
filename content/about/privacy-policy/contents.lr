# Privacy policy
<hr />

If you have any questions about Zenodo's privacy policy, please don't hesitate to [contact us](https://zenodo.org/support).

## Legal framework

Zenodo is hosted at CERN and subject to CERN's special legal status as an Intergovernmental Organization (IGO) and thus enjoys certain privileges and immunities under international law. Processing of personal data at CERN is governed by [CERN's Operational Circular 11 (OC11)](https://privacy.web.cern.ch/cerns-legal-framework) that offers data protection at the same high standards and is comparable to EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## How is your data used

Each service at CERN is responsible for compiling its own Privacy Notice regarding the data it processes.

This Privacy Notice is part of [CERNâ€™s Layered Privacy Notice](https://cern.service-now.com/service-portal?id=layered_privacy_notice) and details the processing that is unique to Zenodo. It does not address processing by other services on which this service may rely and which have their own Privacy Notice.
