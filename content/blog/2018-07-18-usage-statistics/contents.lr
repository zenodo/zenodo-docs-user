We are happy to announce the launch of usage statistics on Zenodo. From today,
you will find the number of views and downloads on record pages, and you can
sort search results by
[most viewed](https://zenodo.org/search?sort=mostviewed).
By default we roll-up usage statistics for all versions of a record. However,
it is also possible to see detailed usage statistics for the specific version
of a record.

### Privacy and standards compliant
We strongly believe in user’s right to privacy, thus we have spend a lot of
time to design our system to ensure all tracking is completely anonymized. Our
usage statistics is further tracked according to industry standards such as
the [COUNTER Code of Practice](https://www.projectcounter.org/)
as well as the [Code of Practice for Research Data Usage Metrics](https://peerj.com/preprints/26505/)
and thus allows you to compare metrics from Zenodo with other compliant
repositories. You can read much more about this, and exactly how and what we
track in our [FAQ](https://help.zenodo.org/#statistics).

The launch today, also only marks the beginning. We will later also be adding
usage statistics e.g for your communities, so stay tuned!

If you have any questions or feedback (positive and negative) don’t hesitate
to [get in touch](https://zenodo.org/support) with us.
