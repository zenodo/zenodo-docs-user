body:

Files in submissions to the EU Open Research Repository are automatically checked against if the format used is **an open or scientific file format**. Open or scientific file formats are important because they ensure long-term accessibility, interoperability, and reuse of research outputs.


The guide covers the following:

Using open or scientific file formats helps ensure that your research outputs remain accessible and reusable in the future. If your data is in a closed proprietary format, consider the following approaches to find an alternative:

- **Check your software options**: Many applications allow you to export or save your data in multiple formats.
- **Beware of conversion pitfalls**: File format conversion is delicate as representation can change or information may be lost, especially with complex data. Always validate the result.
- **Provide both formats**: If you're unsure whether conversion affects your data integrity, consider including both the original and converted files in your upload.
- **Use trusted resources**: Refer to the [Library of Congress Recommended Formats](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/index.html) for guidance on preservation-friendly formats.
- **Ask an AI assistant**: Tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot can help suggest appropriate open or scientific file formats or tools for conversion based on your use case (please however still beware of conversion pitfalls).

When in doubt, include a README file to explain any limitations or choices made during the conversion process.
