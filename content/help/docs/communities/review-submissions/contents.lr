body:

Any Zenodo user can submit records to your community via two different methods:

- [Submit for review](../../share/submit-for-review/) for unpublished records.
- [Submit to community](../../share/submit-to-community/) for published records.

The following sections explain how you as a community curator review these submissions.

##### Review policy

Community owners can set the [review policy](../manage-community-settings/review-policy/) to allow curators, managers and owners to submit without review.

##### Permissions

As a community curator you can:

- edit **unpublished** records **before** you accept them into your community
- edit **published** records **after** you accept them into into your community

##### Publish on accept

An unpublished record is published when you accept the record into the community.
