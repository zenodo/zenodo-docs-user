Each community has a public page that displays the members of the community. A member is displayed on the page if their membership visibility is to **public**.

##### Only members themselves can set public visibility
A member's visibility is by default set to **hidden**, and only the member themselves can set their visibility to **public** to be displayed on the page.

##### Members, owners, managers can all set hidden visibility
A community manager/owner however can set the membership visibility to **hidden** of any member in the community.
