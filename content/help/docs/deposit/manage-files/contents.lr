    **Heads up**: You CANNOT modify files *after* your record is published, instead use [versioning](../manage-versions/).

We support file uploads up 50GB (= 50.000 MB) and max 100 files. See how to [request a quota increase](quota-increase/).

Please take the following into consideration when you prepare your files for upload:
- **20+ files**: We recommend that you package them in a ZIP archive
- **Hidden files**: We often see hidden files in ZIP archives like "__MACOSX", ".DS_Store", or "Thumbs.db" (see these guides on  [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10924236/mac-zip-compress-without-macosx-folder) and [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hidden-files-0320fe58-0117-fd59-6851-9b7f9840fdb2) for how to remove them).
- **No changes**: You CANNOT modify files after your record is published.
- **Use open non-proprietary formats**:  For further guidance on preservation-friendly formats please see the following resources:
    - [Digital Preservation Handbook - File formats and standards](https://www.dpconline.org/handbook/technical-solutions-and-tools/file-formats-and-standards)
    - [Library of Congress recommended format specifications](http://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/index.html)

ref: pending
#### docstext ####
text:

You may experience a file displaying the state **Pending** in the **Progress** column. The pending state means that a file is in progress of being uploaded. It happens e.g.
- If a file is uploaded from a different browser window or by a different user (multiple people can edit a draft)
- If a file upload is broken off and you reload the browser page.

In the latter case, you can follow the [remove file](#remove) to fix the issue.

ref: modify
#### docstext ####
text:

If you would like to modify the files of a record, we recommend that you use our [versioning](../manage-versions/) to create a new version of the record.

We do however offer a one-month grace period after publication in which files can be added, removed or modified. After the one-month grace period we only allow modification in duly justified cases (such as copyright infringements, or exposure of personal data). All requests for modifications must be submitted to our [support line](https://zenodo.org/support), however please consider using our [versioning](../manage-versions/) feature instead.
