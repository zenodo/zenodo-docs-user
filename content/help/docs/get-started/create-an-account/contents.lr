!!! info
    **Want to test Zenodo?** Use our sandbox environment on [https://sandbox.zenodo.org](https://sandbox.zenodo.org) to play.

You can create an account in several ways. If you already have an ORCID or GitHub account we recommend the following options:

- **[Sign up with ORCID](#orcid):** Use your [ORCID](https://orcid.org) account to quickly create an account.
- **[Sign up with GitHub](#github):** Use your [GitHub](https://github.com) account to quickly create an account.

If not, you can create an account directly on Zenodo:

- **[Sign up with local account](#local):** Create a local account by choosing a password.

We advise you to sign up with either GitHub or ORCID and make sure you have enabled two-factor authentication on either GitHub or ORCID for added security. Local accounts on Zenodo do not support two factor authentications.
